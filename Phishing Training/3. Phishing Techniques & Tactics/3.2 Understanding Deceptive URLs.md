Objective:  

By the end of this module, learners should be able to identify deceptive URLs and understand their role in phishing attempts.

  

Introduction to Deceptive URLs:

Definition: URLs crafted to mislead users into believing they are accessing a legitimate website when they are not.

Purpose: To trick users into sharing sensitive information, downloading malware, or simply exploiting them in some way.

  

Common Tactics Used in Deceptive URLs:

  

a) Subdomain Tricks: 

Example: `login.google.com.fake-website.com`  

In this case, "fake-website.com" is the main domain, not "google.com."

  

b) Misspelled Domains: 

Example: `www.googlle.com` or `www.gooogle.com`  

Small typographical errors can lead users to a malicious site.

  

c) Replacing Characters:

Example: `www.g00gle.com` (using zeroes instead of 'o's)  

Using characters that look similar to the actual ones.

  

d) Adding Extra Pathways:  

Example: `www.trustedsite.com.phishing.com/login`  

The actual domain here is "phishing.com."

  

e) Using URL Shorteners:  

Shortened URLs can mask the actual destination, hiding malicious websites.

  

3. Recognizing Safe URLs:

  

   - **HTTPS vs. HTTP:**  

   Always ensure the URL starts with "https://" where 'S' signifies a secure connection.

   - **Checking Certificates:**  

   Legitimate sites often have security certificates (though this isn't foolproof).

   - **Verify Domain:**  

   Cross-check the domain with known legitimate URLs, especially before entering sensitive information.

  

**4. Tools to Assist in Identifying Deceptive URLs:**  

   - **Browser Security Features:**  

   Most modern browsers have built-in phishing and malware protection.

   - **Link Expanders:**  

   Tools that can expand shortened URLs to show the full link before you click.

   - **Third-Party URL Scanners:**  

   Services like VirusTotal or URLVoid can scan URLs for known malicious content.

  

**5. Practical Activity:**  

  

   Provide participants with a list of URLs. Ask them to identify which ones are deceptive based on the tactics covered. This reinforces their ability to recognize and differentiate between legitimate and deceptive URLs.

  

**6. Conclusion:**  

  

   Deceptive URLs play a crucial role in many phishing attempts. Being able to identify them effectively can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to these attacks.

  

**Assessment:**  

After the module, quiz participants on the different tactics used in crafting deceptive URLs, and provide real-world examples to test their ability to spot them.
