**Module: Social Engineering Basics**

**Objective:**  
To introduce participants to the concept of social engineering, its methods, and its significance in the context of information security.

**1. Introduction:**

   - **Defining Social Engineering:** A psychological manipulation technique used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information or performing specific actions that may compromise security.
   
**2. Why Social Engineering Works:**

   a) **Human Psychology:**  
      - Trust: We're inherently trusting, especially of authority figures or known contacts.
      - Desire to Help: Many people have an intrinsic desire to assist others.
      - Fear: Scare tactics, like threats of account closures, can spur quick, often thoughtless actions.
      - Greed: Too-good-to-be-true offers can blind our judgment.
   
   b) **Lack of Awareness:**  
      - Many people aren't familiar with the signs of social engineering, making them more susceptible.

**3. Common Social Engineering Techniques:**

   a) **Pretexting:**  
      - Using a fabricated scenario (pretext) to obtain information from a target. For example, posing as an IT support person to ask for password details.
   
   b) **Baiting:**  
      - Luring victims by dangling something enticing in front of them. This might be a free download that contains malware.
   
   c) **Tailgating (or Piggybacking):**  
      - Gaining physical access to a restricted area by following someone authorized to enter.
   
   d) **Quizzing:**  
      - Using fake surveys or quizzes to gather personal information.
   
   e) **Phishing:**  
      - As previously covered, using deceptive emails or websites to gather sensitive information.

**4. Physical vs. Digital Social Engineering:**

   a) **Physical:**  
      - Techniques that require the attacker to be present, such as tailgating or posing as a maintenance worker.
   
   b) **Digital:**  
      - Techniques executed online or via telecommunication, like phishing or vishing (voice phishing).

**5. The Role of Research:**

   a) **Information Gathering:**  
      - How attackers use public sources (e.g., social media, company websites) to gather information about potential targets to make their scams more convincing.
   
   b) **Importance of Limiting Public Information:**  
      - Emphasizing the need to be careful about what details are shared online.

**6. Defending Against Social Engineering:**

   a) **Awareness:**  
      - Being the first and most crucial defense. Recognize the signs and red flags.
   
   b) **Verification:**  
      - Always verify requests for sensitive information, especially if they're unsolicited. Confirm identities through separate channels.
   
   c) **Limiting Access:**  
      - Don't provide more information than necessary, and always question unusual requests, even from known contacts.

**7. Conclusion:**  

   Social engineering preys on human psychology and behavior, making it one of the most challenging threats to defend against. By understanding its basics and being vigilant, individuals can significantly reduce their vulnerability.

**Assessment:**  
A quiz to gauge participants' grasp of social engineering fundamentals, its techniques, and defense mechanisms.
