**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants should be well-equipped to report phishing attempts accurately and efficiently to relevant authorities and within their organization.

**1. Introduction:**  
   - **The Importance of Reporting:** Understanding the role that reporting plays in combating phishing and protecting others from similar threats.

**2. Identifying a Phishing Attempt:**

   a) **Revisiting the Signs:**  
      - Quick recap of the indicators of phishing emails, links, and websites.
   
   b) **Documenting the Attempt:**  
      - Taking screenshots, saving emails, or copying links for evidence and further analysis.

**3. Internal Reporting (For Organizations):**

   a) **Notify IT or Security Team:**  
      - Understand the internal protocol for reporting suspicious emails or links.
   
   b) **Using Dedicated Reporting Tools:**  
      - Many organizations implement tools (e.g., a button in email clients) for easy reporting of phishing attempts.
   
   c) **Avoid Forwarding the Email:**  
      - Instead of forwarding the suspicious email to colleagues for opinions, always refer to IT or security teams to prevent unintentional clicks.

**4. External Reporting:**

   a) **Email Service Providers (ESPs):**  
      - Platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo! have mechanisms for reporting phishing emails.
   
   b) **Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG):**  
      - Forward phishing emails to reportphishing@apwg.org.
   
   c) **Federal Trade Commission (FTC):**  
      - Use the FTC's official reporting tool or forward phishing emails to reportphishing@ftc.gov.
   
   d) **Browser Reporting:**  
      - Major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge allow users to report phishing websites.
   
   e) **Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3):**  
      - For victims in the United States, phishing attempts can be reported to the FBI's IC3.

**5. Post-Reporting Actions:**

   a) **Stay Updated:**  
      - Check internal or external feedback after reporting to understand if it was indeed a phishing attempt and learn from the experience.
   
   b) **Spread Awareness:**  
      - Share the experience (without sensitive information) with colleagues or friends to educate and protect them from similar threats.

**6. Practical Activity:**  

   - **Reporting Simulation:** Participants receive mock phishing emails and practice the process of reporting through various channels.

**7. Conclusion:**  

   Reporting phishing attempts is not only a reactive measure but also a proactive step in preventing future attacks. By reporting, participants actively contribute to enhancing the cybersecurity landscape and protecting their community.

**Assessment:**  
Quiz participants on the different channels to report phishing attempts, the importance of internal and external reporting, and the steps to take post-reporting.
