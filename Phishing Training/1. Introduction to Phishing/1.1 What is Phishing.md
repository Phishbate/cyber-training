Phishing is a type of social engineering attack used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. Phishing attacks are usually carried out through email, text messages, or social media messages that appear to be from a trusted source.

The aim of a phishing attack is to trick the victim into clicking on a link or opening an attachment that contains malware or a fake login page. Once the victim enters their information on the fake login page, the attacker can use it to gain unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.

Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect. It is important to be vigilant and to always verify the authenticity of emails and messages before clicking on any links or providing any personal information.
