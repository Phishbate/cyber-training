**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants should be able to critically assess URLs to distinguish genuine from malicious ones.

**1. Introduction to URLs:**  
   - **Definition:** A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access websites on the internet.
   - **Importance of Scrutiny:** Cybercriminals often manipulate URLs to deceive users into believing they're visiting a legitimate website.

**2. Structure of a URL:**

   a) **Protocol:**  
      - `http://` or `https://` - Always look for "https" which indicates the website uses an SSL certificate, making it more secure. However, note that even malicious sites can use SSL.
   
   b) **Subdomain:**  
      - E.g., "login" in `login.example.com`.
   
   c) **Domain Name:**  
      - The primary address of the website. E.g., "example" in `www.example.com`.
   
   d) **Top-Level Domain (TLD):**  
      - E.g., ".com", ".org", ".net". Beware of unusual or unexpected TLDs.
   
   e) **Path:**  
      - What comes after the TLD, representing specific pages or resources.

**3. Common Tricks in Fake URLs:**

   a) **Lookalike Domains:**  
      - Using domains that visually resemble popular websites. E.g., `www.gooogle.com` or `www.arnazon.com`.
   
   b) **Misleading Subdomains:**  
      - E.g., `www.amazon.fakecompany.com` - Here, "amazon" is just a subdomain of "fakecompany.com".
   
   c) **Inserting Numbers or Symbols:**  
      - E.g., `www.ama-zon.com` or `www.amaz0n.com`.
   
   d) **Shortened URLs:**  
      - These hide the destination. Always use tools or hover over the link to see the actual URL before clicking.
   
   e) **Additional Characters:**  
      - Appending characters to make the domain look legitimate. E.g., `www.amazon-login.com`.

**4. Safe URL Practices:**

   - **Hover Before Clicking:** Hover over hyperlinks to preview the actual URL without clicking.
   - **Check for HTTPS:** Although not foolproof, HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.
   - **Use URL Expanders:** Tools like CheckShortURL or GetLinkInfo can expand shortened URLs to reveal their true destinations.
   - **Bookmark Important URLs:** For frequently visited and important sites (like banking), use bookmarks instead of clicking links from emails.

**5. Practical Activity:**  

   Provide participants with a list of URLs (mix of genuine and fake). Ask them to analyze and identify the deceptive ones, discussing their findings.

**6. Conclusion:**  

   Recognizing fake URLs is a primary defense against phishing and other cyber threats. A meticulous examination of URLs can protect users from divulging sensitive information or downloading malware.

**Assessment:**  
Present participants with several URLs and descriptions of the supposed sites they lead to. Test their ability to spot inconsistencies and identify potentially malicious URLs.
