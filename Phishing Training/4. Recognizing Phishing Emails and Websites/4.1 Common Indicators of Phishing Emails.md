**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants should be able to recognize the most frequent signs of phishing emails, enhancing their ability to spot and report potential threats.

**1. Introduction:**  
   - **Definition:** Phishing emails are deceptive messages that trick recipients into taking a particular action, like clicking on a malicious link or sharing sensitive data.
   - **Importance of Recognition:** Quick identification and reporting of phishing emails can protect both individuals and organizations from potential harm.

**2. Key Indicators of Phishing Emails:**

   a) **Suspicious Sender Address:**  
      - Emails from unfamiliar senders or slight variations in known email addresses.
      - Domains that look legitimate but have misspellings, e.g., `support@gooogle.com`.

   b) **Urgent or Threatening Language:**  
      - Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency, e.g., "Action required immediately!" or "Your account will be suspended!"

   c) **Mismatched URLs:**  
      - Hovering over a link shows a different URL than the one displayed or a URL that doesn't match the supposed sender.

   d) **Generic Greetings:**  
      - Emails that start with "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of your actual name.

   e) **Unsolicited Attachments:**  
      - Unexpected email attachments, which might contain malware or ransomware.

   f) **Request for Personal Information:**  
      - Legitimate organizations will never ask for sensitive data, such as passwords or social security numbers, via email.

   g) **Spelling and Grammar Mistakes:**  
      - While some phishing emails can be well-written, many have obvious spelling and grammatical errors.

   h) **Too Good to Be True Offers:**  
      - Emails offering unexpected rewards, prizes, or deals can often be bait.

   i) **Inconsistencies in Email Design:**  
      - A mismatch in logos, brand colors, or overall email layout compared to genuine communications from an organization.

**3. Best Practices When Suspecting a Phishing Email:**

   - **Do Not Click:** Never click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails.
   - **Verify Independently:** Contact the organization directly using official contact methods to confirm the email's legitimacy.
   - **Report:** Forward the suspicious email to your organization's IT or security team, or use designated reporting tools.

**4. Practical Activity:**  

   Distribute a mix of legitimate and phishing emails (screenshots or descriptions) to participants. Ask them to identify which ones are phishing attempts and discuss the indicators that gave them away.

**5. Conclusion:**  

   Recognizing phishing emails is a crucial skill in today's digital world. By being vigilant and understanding common indicators, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.

**Assessment:**  
Present participants with a series of email excerpts. Ask them to pinpoint potential phishing indicators and decide whether each email is legitimate or a phishing attempt.
