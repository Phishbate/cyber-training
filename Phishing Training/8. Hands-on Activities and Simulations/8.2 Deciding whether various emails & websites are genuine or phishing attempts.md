**Objective:**  
Equip participants with the knowledge and skills to critically evaluate emails and websites, differentiating between legitimate communications and potential phishing threats.

**1. Introduction:**  
   - **The Subtleties of Phishing:** Understanding that not all phishing attempts are glaringly obvious; some are meticulously crafted to mimic genuine communications.

**2. Evaluating Emails:**

   a) **Sender's Address:**  
      - Confirming the senderâ€™s domain matches the organization's actual domain and checking for subtle misspellings.
   
   b) **Content & Tone:**  
      - Assessing if the content matches typical communications from the sender, and if there's an unexpected sense of urgency or pressure.
   
   c) **Links & Attachments:**  
      - Hovering over links to view the destination URL without clicking and being cautious of unexpected or unsolicited attachments.

   d) **General Legitimacy:**  
      - Considering if the email was expected, if the sender typically communicates in this manner, and if the requests within the email make sense.

**3. Evaluating Websites:**

   a) **URL Inspection:**  
      - Checking the website's URL for "https" and ensuring the domain matches the known legitimate domain.
   
   b) **Site Content:**  
      - Scrutinizing the quality of content, looking for inconsistencies, poor grammar, or anything out of place.
   
   c) **Contact Details:**  
      - Legitimate websites usually have verifiable contact information; phishing sites might lack this or provide fake details.
   
   d) **Certificates:**  
      - Observing the security certificates of the website, and ensuring they are valid and issued by a reputable entity.

**4. Tools & Techniques:**

   a) **Reverse Image Search:**  
      - Using tools to check if images from emails/websites are generic or replicated from legitimate sources.
   
   b) **URL Checkers:**  
      - Utilizing online platforms to determine if a website has been reported as malicious.
   
   c) **Email Header Analysis:**  
      - Digging deeper into email headers to trace its origin and path.

**5. Real-life Scenarios:**

   - **Interactive Analysis:** Participants are presented with a series of real and simulated emails and websites and are asked to determine their legitimacy.

**6. Collaborative Learning:**

   a) **Group Discussions:**  
      - Participants discuss their observations, doubts, and decisions in groups, promoting collective learning.
   
   b) **Feedback Sessions:**  
      - Instructors provide insights into the given scenarios, revealing the correct answers and explaining the reasoning.

**7. Conclusion:**  

   Being able to critically assess and decide on the legitimacy of emails and websites is a crucial skill in the digital age. With the ever-increasing sophistication of phishing attempts, continuous learning and vigilance are paramount.
