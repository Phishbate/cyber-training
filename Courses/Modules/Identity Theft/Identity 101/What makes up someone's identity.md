Your personally identifiable information is any piece of information, or ‘data’, that can help to confirm who you are or how to find you. It may be information on its own or in context with other information.

It can include everyday things that are specific to you, like your:

- full name
- parents’ names
- date of birth
- phone number/s
- home address
- location check-ins
- event RSVPs
- school
- email address
- photos
- usernames, passwords or passphrases
- bank account details.

Nearly every app, social media platform or website asks you for at least some personally identifiable information. But this data can be stolen or misused. That’s why it’s important to keep it as private and secure as possible. If you have to share it, make sure it’s only used by trusted services with your knowledge and consent.
