# Phishing Awareness Training


## Master your employee's digital impulse

Technology helps your team work faster but it also ramps up people’s compulsion to click without blinking or thinking. It takes just one uneducated click to open your business’ virtual door to a corporate hacker and bypass your expensive software defences. Don’t risk data theft, exposure or extortion because of unschooled staff.

*Just weeks after hackers had stolen the personal details of 76 million customers of a multinational bank, 20% of bank staff clicked on a simulated phishing email. At that average rate, even a small workforce of 200 would provide cybercrims with 40 avenues to access corporate data.*

## Recognising Phishing Emails

**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants should be able to recognize the most frequent signs of phishing emails, enhancing their ability to spot and report potential threats.

**1. Introduction:**  
   - **Definition:** Phishing emails are deceptive messages that trick recipients into taking a particular action, like clicking on a malicious link or sharing sensitive data.
   - **Importance of Recognition:** Quick identification and reporting of phishing emails can protect both individuals and organizations from potential harm.

**2. Key Indicators of Phishing Emails:**

   a) **Suspicious Sender Address:**  
      - Emails from unfamiliar senders or slight variations in known email addresses.
      - Domains that look legitimate but have misspellings, e.g., `support@gooogle.com`.

   b) **Urgent or Threatening Language:**  
      - Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency, e.g., "Action required immediately!" or "Your account will be suspended!"

   c) **Mismatched URLs:**  
      - Hovering over a link shows a different URL than the one displayed or a URL that doesn't match the supposed sender.

   d) **Generic Greetings:**  
      - Emails that start with "Dear Customer" or "Dear User" instead of your actual name.

   e) **Unsolicited Attachments:**  
      - Unexpected email attachments, which might contain malware or ransomware.

   f) **Request for Personal Information:**  
      - Legitimate organizations will never ask for sensitive data, such as passwords or social security numbers, via email.

   g) **Spelling and Grammar Mistakes:**  
      - While some phishing emails can be well-written, many have obvious spelling and grammatical errors.

   h) **Too Good to Be True Offers:**  
      - Emails offering unexpected rewards, prizes, or deals can often be bait.

   i) **Inconsistencies in Email Design:**  
      - A mismatch in logos, brand colors, or overall email layout compared to genuine communications from an organization.

**3. Best Practices When Suspecting a Phishing Email:**

   - **Do Not Click:** Never click on links or download attachments from suspicious emails.
   - **Verify Independently:** Contact the organization directly using official contact methods to confirm the email's legitimacy.
   - **Report:** Forward the suspicious email to your organization's IT or security team, or use designated reporting tools.

**4. Practical Activity:**  

   Distribute a mix of legitimate and phishing emails (screenshots or descriptions) to participants. Ask them to identify which ones are phishing attempts and discuss the indicators that gave them away.

**5. Conclusion:**  

   Recognizing phishing emails is a crucial skill in today's digital world. By being vigilant and understanding common indicators, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.

**Assessment:**  
Present participants with a series of email excerpts. Ask them to pinpoint potential phishing indicators and decide whether each email is legitimate or a phishing attempt.
