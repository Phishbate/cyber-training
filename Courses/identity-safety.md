## What is identity theft?
Your identity is one of the most valuable things you have. Being able to prove who you are is important for most aspects of your life â€“ from getting a home loan to starting a new job to buying something online. If criminals steal your identity, you may find everyday activities like these more difficult. The stress and financial costs can last for years. The Australian government has published this booklet to help you protect your identity. It includes a number of quick and easy tips you can use to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft. You will also find suggestions about what you should do if your identity has been stolen. You can never completely protect your personal information from falling into the wrong hands. However, if you follow the advice in this course you can significantly reduce the risk.
