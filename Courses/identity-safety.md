The Australian government has published this booklet to help you protect your identity. It
includes a number of quick and easy tips you can use to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft. You will also find suggestions about what you should do if your identity has been stolen.

### How safe is your identity?

--{{1}}--
According to a 2021 poll by Debt.com, four in 10 people reported being victims of identity theft. While that might leave room for many people to say, “Oh, it won’t happen to me,” new figures on rising instances of identity theft bring cause for alarm.

--{{2}}--
According to a February 2021 report from the Federal Trade Commission, Americans reported losing $3.3 billion to fraud in 2020–a significant jump from the $1.8 billion reported in 2019. The number of Americans reporting losing money to fraud is also on the rise, with 34% of 2020 fraud reports citing loss of money, versus 23% in 2019.

In 2021, rising identity theft cases came from an unlikely source: government benefits. Naftali Harris, co-founder and CEO of [SentiLink](https://www.sentilink.com/), a firm specializing in fraud schemes, tactics and identity verification, says “Much of this is due to fraudsters taking advantage of weakly secured unemployment insurance programs [and fraudsters] stealing the identities of citizens and claiming benefits in their name,” he says.

Data from the FTC shows that consumers reported 40 times more benefits fraud to the FTC in Q1 2021 than Q1 2020, likely linked to the increase in unemployment filings due to pandemic shutdowns and job market stresses.

### Targets of Identity Theft

**Who Is Most Vulnerable to Identity Theft?**

Simply having a Social Security number makes you at-risk for identity fraud, yet specific populations are more vulnerable to identity breaches.

- **Children:** Thieves particularly like children because they can use their Social Security numbers to create clean credit profiles for someone with a bad credit history or looking to open fraudulent accounts. Family members are often the offenders since they may have access to a child’s Social Security number.
- **Seniors:** As they’re often less tech-savvy than younger folks, seniors are more likely to fall prey to internet phishing and telephone scams.
- **Social media users:** Those prolific on social media have vast amounts of identifying information online, making them easy targets for resourceful fraudsters. For example, many people who were excited to get their Covid-19 vaccine posted photos of their vaccine cards online, which [contain lots of identifying personal information](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/02/social-media-no-place-covid-19-vaccination-cards), including your full name and date of birth.
- **Military:** When active-duty military are deployed, they’re less likely to notice anything awry in their credit reports, and frequent relocation means their personal information gets shared with greater frequency.

### What is identity theft?


Your identity is one of the most valuable things you have. Being able to prove who you are is important for most aspects of your life – from getting a home loan to starting a new job to buying something online. If criminals steal your identity, you may find everyday activities like these more difficult. The stress and financial costs can last for years.

You will also find suggestions about what you should do if your identity has been stolen. You can never completely protect your personal information from falling into the wrong hands. However, if you follow the advice in this course you can significantly reduce the risk.

### What makes up your identity?
Your personally identifiable information (PII) is any piece of information, or ‘data’, that can help to confirm who you are or how to find you. It may be information on its own or in context with other information.

It can include everyday things that are specific to you, like your:

- full name
- parents’ names
- date of birth
- phone number/s
- home address
- location check-ins
- event RSVPs
- school
- email address
- photos
- usernames, passwords or passphrases
- bank account details.

Nearly every app, social media platform or website asks you for at least some personally identifiable information. But this data can be stolen or misused. That’s why it’s important to keep it as private and secure as possible. If you have to share it, make sure it’s only used by trusted services with your knowledge and consent.

## Why Identity Theft Matters

### Consequences for victims?

Identity theft is a serious problem that can cause significant financial, emotional, and reputational damage. Here are some key reasons why you should be concerned about identity theft:

Financial losses: Identity thieves can use your personal information to access your bank accounts, credit cards, and other financial accounts, and steal your money or make fraudulent purchases in your name. This can result in significant financial losses, and it can take a long time to recover your money and restore your credit.
Damage to your credit score: Identity theft can also damage your credit score, which can make it more difficult to obtain loans, credit cards, and other financial products. It can take years to repair your credit score after an identity theft incident.
Emotional distress: Identity theft can cause significant emotional distress, including anxiety, stress, and feelings of violation. Victims may also feel a sense of vulnerability and helplessness, as they may not know how the thief obtained their personal information or how to prevent it from happening again.
Reputational damage: Identity theft can also damage your reputation, as the thief may use your name and personal information to engage in criminal activity or other unsavory behavior. This can lead to embarrassment and a loss of trust from friends, family, and colleagues.

## How your information is compromised

### Who wants my PII?
- **Scammers and identity thieves.** If scammers and identity thieves uncover your personally identifiable information, they can pretend to be you and create fake accounts in your name, and act in ways that could impact you now or in the future. This could include fraud like stealing money from your bank account or taking out a loan in your name.
- **Bullies and doxers.** There may be people on the internet who want to use your data for personal motives. A bully might use your email and password to pose as you and share mean or embarrassing content on your social media accounts, while a ‘doxer’ might share your street address and name with people who want to scare or harm you.
- **Social media companies, games, apps and shopping sites.** Many companies collect your data to make money through selling it to marketers or by targeting you with personalised ads. If the service is free, generally it’s your data that is being solen


### How information is stolen

Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Here are some common ways that your identity can be stolen:

1. Phishing: This is when criminals use emails, text messages or phone calls to trick you into giving them your personal information, such as your social security number, date of birth, passwords, or bank account information.
2. Social engineering: This is when criminals use psychological tricks to gain your trust and persuade you to reveal your personal information. For example, they may pretend to be someone you know or a company you do business with.
3. Data breaches: This is when a hacker gains unauthorized access to a company's computer system and steals the personal information of its customers, employees or other stakeholders.
4. Skimming: This is when a criminal uses a small electronic device to steal your credit or debit card information when you use it at an ATM or a point-of-sale terminal.
5. Dumpster diving: This is when a criminal goes through your trash or recycling to find documents that contain your personal information, such as bank statements or credit card offers.
6. Mail theft: This is when a criminal steals your mail to obtain personal information, such as credit card statements or tax documents.
7. Shoulder surfing: This is when a criminal watches over your shoulder as you enter your PIN or other personal information into an electronic device, such as an ATM or a computer.

To protect yourself from identity theft, you should be vigilant about protecting your personal information, such as your social security number, bank account information, and passwords. You should also monitor your credit reports regularly and report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.

## Prevention techniques
While there’s no guarantee that your identity won’t be stolen, the steps below can help you take immediate action to make your personal and financial information more secure.



### Simple Checks 

1. **Check your credit reports.** It’s easy to get a [free weekly copy of your credit report](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action) from all three credit bureaus. Checking your credit can help you keep an eye out for fraudulent activity like new credit cards or loans and inquiries you don’t recognize.
2. **Freeze your credit reports.** Freezing your credit reports makes it impossible for new accounts to be opened in your name unless you remove the freeze. Temporarily lifting or completely removing a freeze can be done online with each of the credit bureaus using a password or PIN assigned during the initial freeze.
3. **Use a password manager.** Storing all those passwords in your browser can leave them vulnerable to malware and other hacks. [Password managers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-password-managers/) offer an encrypted way to store your private login information so that it’s both easily accessible (to you) and hard to access by anyone else. The most popular password managers are fee-based services available by subscription.
4. **Put password or biometric protection on your devices.** In 2018, Kaspersky Labs found that 52 percent of people don’t password-protect their phones. Turning on password or biometric identification (like fingerprints or facial recognition) can prevent a thief from accessing personal information on your phone.
5. **Avoid using public WiFi.** Free public WiFi can seem like a score, but open networks make it easy for scammers to connect to your devices. Avoid accessing your financial accounts over unsecured public WiFi connections.
6. **Shred your documents.** Bank statements, anything with your Social Security number, old credit cards–they’re all delicious finds in your trash for identity thieves. You can purchase a cross-cut or micro-cut shredder (the most secure) or stay on the lookout for community shredding events.
7. **Invest in security software.** [Antivirus and malware software](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-antivirus-software/) can help you detect attempts to access your personal information by resourceful online scammers and many times, neutralize those threats. Annual fees can range from $35-$100.
8. **Be a bit less social.** If you’re on social media, enable the strongest security measures available on your accounts. For example, [these tips from Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/213481848684090) can help you quickly assess and protect your account. Additionally, be cautious about the information you make public, like your full name, city of residence, employer and birth date.
9. **Sign up for free credit monitoring.** Companies like Capital One and Discover offer free credit monitoring to their cardholders. You can also use free monitoring tools available from many of the credit bureaus or Credit Karma, which provides free credit monitoring of your Equifax and TransUnion credit reports.
10. **Check for data leaks online.** There’s an easy way to see if your data’s been compromised or found on the dark web: ask the internet. Sites like [F-Secure](https://www.f-secure.com/us-en/home/free-tools/identity-theft-checker) and [have i been pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) are free and easy–just enter your email address. If you find an account that’s been compromised, you can easily reset your password and see if the website offers two-factor authentication to help further secure your account.

### Identity Protection Software

**Should I Pay for Identity Protection?**

If you’re considering paying for identity protection, there are many companies ready to offer a subscription. The [best identity theft protection services](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/best-identity-theft-protection-services/) come with added perks, like help resolving identity theft instances and insurance up to $1 million if your identity is compromised.

However, it’s difficult to justify the cost with all the free tools available from reputable companies like Experian, Credit Karma, and various credit card issuers. If you want the convenience of a paid subscription and added bells and whistles, you might find a paid identity monitoring service makes sense.
