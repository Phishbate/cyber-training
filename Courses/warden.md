# The biggest threat to your business

95% of cyber attacks target people who work in your business and are not technology failures.

When we think of cyber security risks, often the first thing that pops into our heads is the threats we face from hackers.  

You probably have an idea of a hooded mastermind breaking through firewalls and cracking complicated codes — basically, an evil tech genius.

In reality, though, scammers are more like criminal pranksters. 

They lay clever traps for people who work in small businesses, hoping you'll fall into one — most digital break-ins (data breaches) happen this way.

Even the most digitally savvy amongst us needs a refresh on cyber security basics, so we can ensure we’re  up-to-date on how to stay cyber safe (Pro tip: Your whole team should do this training).

## Human error

Cyber criminals are deliberately trying to trick you into making a mistake. It can be easy to miss a cyber security threat.

## Working offsite

There's nothing better than enjoying a coffee at the cafe while checking off your work to-do list. However, just like you'd keep your bag tucked under your legs and your wallet out of reach, ensure others can't see or access your sensitive business information in public places.

## Being busy and missing detail

It’s harder to spot a scam when your to-do list is overflowing and you’re busy trying to tick it all off.

## Hackers target you personally

While a computer or network may be able to flag or block many threats, certain cyber attacks prey on emotion or can do their research to target you personally.
