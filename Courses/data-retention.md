**Data Breaches**
2,784 "Email accounts are being used to store sensitive personal information, where it may be accessed by malicious third parties who breach these accounts" - Angelene Falk, Australian Information & Privacy Commissioner 28/02/2020

## The Data Hording Mentality
The data hording mentality "Let's keep it just in case"

Examples:
- 24 years of emails
- 14 years of non-won quotes
- 13 years of non-paid policies
- 12 years of personal one-drives, related to former staff members

## PII Non-Compliance
PII Non-Compliance (Inherent) Risk Rating
1. Sustainable
2. Moderate
3. Severe
4. Critical

## Implementing Good Data Retention Strategy

The Road to Success!
1. Conduct a data retention maturity assessment
2. Implement the approved data retention periods, starting with HIGH RISK systems (Retired / TP / Backups / DR)
3. Educate your team on privacy legislation changes, industry trends and data purge benefits ($CS, DQI)
4. Review existing data retention periods in line with APP changes
5. Update external / Third Party contracts to include data purge requirements
6. Ongoing PII Risk measurement, system remediation and metadata quality improvements using AI

## Data Retention Compliance Process
The data Retention Compliance Process targets the assessment, identification, remediation and ongoing regulation of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). 

**Assess**
Review the data contained in the application for PII. Understand. Understand business usage of the data, current or previous. Determine whether the data is deemed source or is a copy. Understand how the data flows into and out of the application. (ie upstream and downstream)

**Identify**
Locate data classified as PII across storage and archival locations. Can extend to data lineage, data accountabilities as per the data governance organisation, internal and external obligations and requirements for data retention.

**Remediate**
Take outputs from the identify process and treat that identified data to ensure permanent and irreversible de-identification PII. This can include deletion or redaction of non-compliant records based on the retention outcome required.

**Regulate**
Ongoing compliance to data standards, including an audit report or process followed, approvals received, and data treated.
Implement a cadence for re-runs of the remediation process. Should include criteria to exit the process and conduct a full data retention review, e.g. regulation or system change.

## Identifying PII Non-Compliance (Inherent) Risk
What drives the Non-Compliance (Inherent) Risk Rating?

### PII Sensitivity Level / Disclosure Impact
What PII does the system (underlying datasets) contain?

**Low:**
- Landline Phone Numbers
- Fax Number
- Gender

**Medium:**
- Full Name or First, Middle and Surname induvidually
- Date of Birth
- Interconnections, including work details, family

**High:**
- Email Address
- Mobile Phone Number
- Home Address
- Mother's maiden name
- Place of Birth

**Extreme:**
- Tax File Number
- Passport Image / Number
- Drivers License Image / Number
- Medicare card image / Number
- Medical information / Images
- Bank details
- PCIDSS (Credit card numbers)

### Data Retention Period
How long is the PII being stored for?

**Low:**
< Data Retention Standard

**Medium:**
= Data Retention Standard

**High:**
> Data Retention Standard

**Extreme:**
> Data Retention Standard (Indefinitely)


## Recommendations

Future Data Backups:
- Purge the PII from the backups (the older the data, the less it's value for disaster recovery)
- Only hold PII in back ups for 90 days, after it was deleted from Production
- Increase the back-up frequency (in smaller increments) 45 x daily, 4 x weekly, 3 x monthly

# Information Security

Information security refers to the measures taken to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. This includes protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Information security is crucial for organizations to protect their sensitive data and ensure business continuity.

When creating an information security policy, it is important to include the following information:

- Identification of sensitive information: This includes information such as personal data, financial data, intellectual property, and confidential business information.
- Access control: This outlines who has access to specific information and what controls are in place to ensure that access is authorized. This includes password policies, user access levels, and authentication protocols.
- Incident response: This outlines the steps that will be taken in the event of a security breach or incident. This includes reporting, investigation, and resolution processes.
- Physical security: This includes physical measures to protect information such as locks, cameras, and access controls.
- Security awareness training: This outlines the training that will be provided to employees to educate them on security best practices and their roles in protecting sensitive information.

By including these elements in an information security policy, organizations can ensure that their information is protected from unauthorized access and breaches.
