# Password Management


1. Use a unique password for each account: Do not use the same password across multiple accounts.
2. Use a mix of characters: Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in your passwords.
3. Avoid using personal information: Do not use personal information such as your name, birthdate, or address in your passwords.
4. Use long passwords: Use a password that is at least 12 characters long.
5. Create intricate passwords. Passwords that include the last four digits of your Social Security number, your graduation date, or your maiden name may be easy to memorize, but they're also easy to crack. Use a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a foolproof password, and alter it for every online account you have.
6. Make them clever, too. Come up with a phrase and use the first letter of each word, a special character, and a number as your password. For example: "I graduated from Central High School number 1." Password: "igfchs#1." And for each site, change the number or a character, or add letters corresponding to the particular website. For example, if you visit [target.com](http://target.com), your password would be "taigfchs#1."
7. Use passphrases: Consider using passphrases instead of passwords. Passphrases are longer and easier to remember than passwords.
8. Do not write down passwords: Avoid writing down passwords, especially in a visible location.
9. Use a password manager: Use a reputable password manager to generate and store strong and unique passwords for each of your accounts.
10. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to your phone.
11. Change passwords regularly: Change your passwords regularly, at least once every three months.
12. Be cautious of phishing scams: Be cautious of emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source but are actually phishing scams. Check the sender's email or phone number and look for other signs that the message may be fake.
13. Be cautious of public Wi-Fi: Avoid using public Wi-Fi to access sensitive information such as banking or email. If you must use public Wi-Fi, use a VPN and avoid entering passwords or other sensitive information.
14. Do not share passwords: Do not share your passwords with anyone, even family members or friends.
15. Biometrics
    1. Thumbprint
    2. Phase ID
