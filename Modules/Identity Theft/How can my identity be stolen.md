Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information without your consent to commit fraud or other crimes. Here are some common ways that your identity can be stolen:

1. Phishing: This is when criminals use emails, text messages or phone calls to trick you into giving them your personal information, such as your social security number, date of birth, passwords, or bank account information.
2. Social engineering: This is when criminals use psychological tricks to gain your trust and persuade you to reveal your personal information. For example, they may pretend to be someone you know or a company you do business with.
3. Data breaches: This is when a hacker gains unauthorized access to a company's computer system and steals the personal information of its customers, employees or other stakeholders.
4. Skimming: This is when a criminal uses a small electronic device to steal your credit or debit card information when you use it at an ATM or a point-of-sale terminal.
5. Dumpster diving: This is when a criminal goes through your trash or recycling to find documents that contain your personal information, such as bank statements or credit card offers.
6. Mail theft: This is when a criminal steals your mail to obtain personal information, such as credit card statements or tax documents.
7. Shoulder surfing: This is when a criminal watches over your shoulder as you enter your PIN or other personal information into an electronic device, such as an ATM or a computer.

To protect yourself from identity theft, you should be vigilant about protecting your personal information, such as your social security number, bank account information, and passwords. You should also monitor your credit reports regularly and report any suspicious activity to the relevant authorities.
