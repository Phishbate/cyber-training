- Get fraud alert. Most credit card companies offer fraud protection, some for free and others for a slight fee. These programs alert you when there are any abnormal purchases or activity on your account.
- Consider a credit freeze. A credit freeze prevents credit card companies and other third parties from viewing your credit report. It gives you a little more protection than a fraud alert, but also a little less leeway: You'll need to lift the freeze if you want to apply for a loan or a credit card.
