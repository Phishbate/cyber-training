**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants will be able to confidently engage with simulated phishing emails, understand their purpose, and effectively identify and respond to them.

**1. Introduction:**  
   - **Purpose of Simulated Phishing:** Explaining the role of simulations in training and assessing the organization's phishing awareness.
   - **Safe Environment:** Emphasizing that simulated emails offer a risk-free way to learn and practice.

**2. Identifying Simulated Phishing Emails:**

   a) **Key Indicators:**  
      - While they mimic real phishing emails, simulations might have specific identifiers for training purposes.
   
   b) **Purposeful Red Flags:**  
      - Understanding that certain obvious red flags might be intentionally included to train the eye.

**3. Engaging with the Simulation:**

   a) **Opening the Email:**  
      - Safe practices when opening a potential phishing email (real or simulated).
   
   b) **Avoid Clicking Links:**  
      - Even in simulations, foster the habit of not clicking on suspicious links.
   
   c) **Attachments:**  
      - Never download or open attachments from unknown sources, even in simulated environments.

**4. Reporting the Simulated Phishing Attempt:**

   a) **Using Reporting Tools:**  
      - How to use internal tools to report the simulated phishing attempt.
   
   b) **Direct Communication:**  
      - Reporting to the IT/security team or training facilitator about the observed simulated phishing email.

**5. Feedback and Analysis:**

   a) **Reviewing Performance:**  
      - Post-simulation, participants may receive feedback on their actions, decisions, and reporting speed.
   
   b) **Discussing Common Mistakes:**  
      - Analyzing areas where participants commonly err or overlook red flags.
   
   c) **Learning from Peers:**  
      - Sharing experiences and observations with colleagues to learn collectively.

**6. Practical Activity:**  

   - **Live Simulation Drill:** Participants engage in real-time with a series of simulated phishing emails, testing their awareness and response strategies.

**7. Conclusion:**  

   Engaging with simulated phishing emails is a vital training exercise to hone one's skills in detecting and responding to real-world phishing threats. The experience offers a safe space to learn, make mistakes, and improve.

**Assessment:**  
Quiz participants on the key differences between real and simulated phishing emails, the importance of simulated drills, and best practices when encountering potential phishing threats.
