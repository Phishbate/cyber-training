**Objective:**  
By the end of this module, participants should be able to extract and analyze email headers to identify potential signs of phishing or other malicious activities.

**1. Introduction to Email Headers:**  
   - **Definition:** An email header is a section of metadata that accompanies an email, containing details about the sender, recipient, path the email has taken, and more.
   - **Relevance:** Headers can offer clues about the legitimacy of an email, helping identify spoofed or malicious messages.

**2. Accessing Email Headers:**

   a) **Different Platforms:**  
      - Instructions on how to access headers in popular email clients like Outlook, Gmail, and others.
   b) **Extraction:**  
      - Highlight that headers can be lengthy and intimidating, but knowing what to look for is key.

**3. Key Components of an Email Header and their Analysis:**

   a) **Return-Path:**  
      - The email address that bounce-backs are sent to if the email fails to deliver.
      - Look for mismatches between this and the "From" address.
   
   b) **Received:**  
      - Lists servers the email passed through to reach the recipient. 
      - Multiple 'Received' fields exist, with the most recent at the top. Suspicious or unknown servers could be a red flag.

   c) **From:**  
      - The email address of the sender. 
      - Beware of slight misspellings or domain names that don't match the supposed sender's organization.

   d) **Subject:**  
      - The topic of the email.
      - Sometimes manipulated to induce urgency or action.

   e) **X-Mailer:**  
      - Software used to send the email.
      - Unknown or unconventional email sending software could be a sign of phishing.

   f) **Authentication Results:**  
      - Provides details about the results of authentication checks.
      - Emails failing SPF, DKIM, or DMARC checks could be spoofed.

**4. Red Flags in Email Headers:**

   - **Mismatched Domains:** Inconsistencies between sender and return-path domains.
   - **Unusual IP Addresses:** Check the IP addresses in the "Received" fields against known or expected IPs.
   - **Failed Authentications:** SPF, DKIM, or DMARC failures.
   - **Unknown Software in X-Mailer:** Unrecognized or rarely-used email software.

**5. Tools and Resources:**  

   Introduce participants to online tools that can simplify header analysis:
   - **MXToolBox:** A comprehensive tool that provides a breakdown of header data.
   - **Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader:** Useful for quickly analyzing header data.

**6. Practical Activity:**  

   Supply participants with sample email headers (both legitimate and malicious). Ask them to analyze and identify potential red flags.

**7. Conclusion:**  

   While email headers can be intricate, understanding their components and knowing what to look for can be instrumental in identifying phishing attempts and other malicious activities.

**Assessment:**  
Provide participants with several email headers. Test their ability to extract relevant information, identify inconsistencies, and spot potential phishing indicators.
