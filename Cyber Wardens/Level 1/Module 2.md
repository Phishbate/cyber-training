Your business isn't just bricks and mortar or an online shop. It's founded on crucial information which you store to operate day-to-day.

### **How can cyber criminals use the information your business holds?**

**Social media accounts**
Social media accounts contain data, such as usernames and any information in your public profile. They can be used to create fake profiles for scammers to send spam messages and links to malicious websites.

**Website**
Your website potentially contains email addresses, support ticket records, online reviews and customer transactions. Scammers use these for identity theft, creating bogus websites under your profile and harming reputation.

**Invoices**
Invoices contain data such as your bank account details and customer contact information. Cyber criminals can use these details for fake invoice and payment redirection scams.

**Payment processing**
Criminals target financial tools and platforms such as online checkouts to steal customer banking and personal information

**Customer contact details**
Emails, phone numbers and birth dates. This is really important data that you use to run your business! Imagine if you lost all of your customers' emails? Then imagine all those emails in the hands of a scammer?

**Your bank account details**
This is data. Scammers can use your personal information to steal your money and run up debts in your name.

As you can see, over time, you’ve built up a great collection of data.  

And this is priceless for a cyber criminal.

# Let's recap: Data

Just like you'd keep important documents in a safe, your digital data needs to be kept secure.

Let's review below:

**Digital break-ins**
When there's a data breach (a digital break-in), your business, or you as an individual could experience identity theft, reputation damage or business loss.

**Confidential information**
Confidential information can include details about business processes or products as well as employee or customer personal details. This is sensitive data to protect.

**Keep it safe**
Keeping your data safe and confidential ensures that sensitive information doesn't end up in the wrong hands!
