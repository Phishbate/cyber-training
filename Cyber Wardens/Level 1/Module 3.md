There are three basic steps that will help you prevent and recover from attacks.

**Step #1:**  Defend against digital break-ins with **automatic updates**.

The first step to lock your digital doors? Automatic updates.

I'm ready!

# Step one: Automatic updates

**Most things are automated these days — from the garage door, through to scheduled bank payments. So, why aren’t you setting up automatic updates for your software?**

![Graphic of woman standing in front of phone with apple, android and windows icons](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/VqYlRcpbX7Kkfge9_d-NkWM-jwrYn5XU-.jpg)

When your software is not up to date, it’s like leaving the doors to your business unlocked.

**Cyber criminals never stop looking for cracks in your systems**, so you need to continually download the latest version of software to your devices.

![Graphic of cyber criminal holding key in front of laptop](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/k2CIQQSKKpcewo0c_xUhY2w3wUzAKAT5H.png)

The easiest way to stay on top is by **turning on or conﬁrming automatic updates**, where possible.
![Graphic of woman sitting with laptop in lap, and lock and settings/cogs icons in background](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/kT0Wt7E2YIkI7be2_n_7WYSD5SFwlMYtj.jpg)

An automatic update is a feature that **seamlessly updates** your software as soon as it becomes available. This way you can relax knowing you’re always using the most secure version.

Software providers issue updates to protect you against current security threats and provide you with improved tools and services. When you set up automatic updates, it's a win-win — better security and the latest features.

So where do I begin?

Automatic Updates 101

## Device Audit
![Aerial view of desk with devices](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/F3hIPpEOkJboVIOA_Pye6M54cazay8Y_A.jpg)

**Make a list of the devices used in your business.** _**Every**_ **device needs automatic updates turned on.**

If they login remotely, this might include your team’s personal phones and devices.

## Protect the foundation

**Set up automatic updates on your device operating systems.** 

Get your computers and mobile devices up to date, then set them to refresh automatically.

## Bulk up security

![Hands holding phone while update occurring on screen](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/YOn0F_4lZLbF4PkN_T6_gLCgP_3g5achl.jpg)

**Set your apps, plug-ins and browsers to auto-update.** 

For iPhones, go to Settings. Tap App Store. Turn on App Updates.

Android is just as easy. Go to the Google Play Store app. At the top right, tap the profile icon. Tap Settings Network Preferences. Tap auto-update apps.

## Defend against break-ins
![Hand touching touchscreen](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/feIyfH5c2lqGvkjl_8g8feQOVQAO_ALMn.jpg)
**Remember your other devices too.**

Ensure payment machines, security systems and any internet-enabled smart devices are running on the latest versions, then turn on automatic updates where possible.

## Secure your digital shopfront

**Don't forget your website!**

Website platforms such as WordPress or Squarespace, along with their plug-ins and third-party extensions, need updating too. When you log in to the administrator section of your website, make all updates to your website and plug-ins automatic to secure your digital space.

## Safeguard
![Hands on laptop keyboard](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/EiZVnrqVAUxZ6S5i_1UVk1iSPsgBK2up-.jpg)
**If you have antivirus software, set up auto-updates.** 

Anti-virus software is often built into your operating system — but just confirm with your trusted IT retailer if you're unsure.

## BONUS TIP:

**Uninstall anything you're not using.**

Do you have any apps and software on your devices that you have not used in a while? Chances are that updates have slipped on those, too. Regularly reviewing installed software means you're saving space on your drive AND ensuring there isn't any outdated software with vulnerabilities installed.
![Image of laptop screen with update occurring](https://train.cyberwardens.com.au/wp-content/uploads/uncanny-snc/39/assets/3motqq3csPkXnEMh_hN4yJyhsoftZ2ix6.jpg)

Keeping systems up to date is one of the easiest ways to ensure protection against hackers who target weaknesses in outdated systems.

If you receive a prompt to update your operating system or other software, you should install the update as soon as possible.
